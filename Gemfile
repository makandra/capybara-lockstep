# The following gems were previously "default gems" (always available) and are now
# "bundled gems" (need to be explicitly required). Not all gems in our Gemfile.lock (dev only) do that yet.
# To avoid splitting the Gemfile.lock by Ruby version (gemika test setup), we instead require those
# indirect dependencies ourselves.
